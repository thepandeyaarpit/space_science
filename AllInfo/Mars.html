                Mars is often dubbed the “Red Planet” because of the iron on its surface. It is the fourth planet from the Sun, located around 228 million km (142 million mi) away. This is a dry desert world that is also very cold.
                <br>
                Mars has been known by the ancients, looking like a reddish point in the night sky. With an apparent magnitude of around 1.50, we can readily spot it under a dark sky.
                <br>
                The red planet got its name from the Roman god of war whose Greek equivalent is Ares. It has two satellites—the most moons of any terrestrial planet. Phobos and Deimos have irregular shapes. They are named after the sons of Ares (Mars) in Greek mythology.

            <div class="content">
                <p>and last of the terrestrial planets and is around 227,940,000 km from the Sun.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">The planet is named after Mars, the Roman god of war. </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>It was known to the ancient Greeks as Ares, their god of war. This is thought to be because of the blood-red color of the planet which was also used by other ancient cultures. Chinese astronomers call Mars the “fire star” while ancient Egyptian priests called it “Her Desher” meaning “the red one”.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible"> The landmass of Mars and Earth is very similar.</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Despite Mars being just 15% the volume and 10% the mass of Earth, it actually has a similar landmass because water covers about 70% of Earth’s surface. The surface gravity of Mars is about 37% the gravity found on Earth. This means that on Mars you could in theory jump 3x higher than you could on Earth.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Only 16 of the 39 Mars missions have been successful. </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Beginning with the USSR’s Marsnik 1 which was launched in 1960, 39 orbiters, landers and rovers have been to Mars but only 16 of those missions were a success. In 2016, Europe’s Exobiology on Mars program will search the planet for signs of Martian life as well as study the surface and terrain of the planet and map potential environmental hazards to future manned missions to Mars.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pieces of Mars have been found on Earth. </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>It is believed that trace amounts of the Martian atmosphere were within meteorites that the planet ejected. These meteorites then orbited the solar system for millions of years amongst the other objects and solar debris before eventually entering the Earth’s atmosphere and crashing to the ground. The study of this material has allowed scientists to discover more about Mars before launching space missions.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The northern cap is called the Planum Boreum, with Planum Australe in the south. Water ice has also been found under the Martian ice caps.</p>
