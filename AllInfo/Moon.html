            <h2 class="heading-text">About</h2>
        <p class="about-text">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, circling the planet at an average distance of roughly 385,000 kilometers (239,000 miles). <br>
            With a diameter of just under 3,500 kilometers (about 2,160 miles), the cratered surface of the rocky object is one of the most recognisable objects in the sky.
        <br>A single orbit of our planet takes the Moon 27.3 Earth days - the same amount of time it takes for the satellite to also rotate once on its axis. As a result, half of the Moon's surface perpetually faces Earth. <br>

            The other half (erroneously referred to as the dark side of the Moon, in spite of receiving the same amount of sunlight as the more familiar side) was finally seen for the first time in 1959 when the Soviet probe Luna 3 beamed back a grainy set of photographs.  <br>
            
            This 'tidally locked' orbit is the result of Earth and the Moon pulling on one another, slowing the rotation of each. Earth's own rotation has similarly been affected by the braking effect of the Moon's gravity, adding around 1.4 milliseconds to our day every century. <br>
            
            At the same time, the Moon is gradually inching away from our world, adding anywhere from a few millimetres to nearly 30 centimetres to its orbiting distance every year. Back when it formed some 4.5 billion years ago, the Moon was 16 times closer, looming an estimated 24 times larger in the sky.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Interesting facts about the Moon</h3>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">The Moon is Earth's only permanent natural satellite</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">The Moon is the second-densest satellite</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Among those whose densities are known anyway. The first densest is Jupiter's satellite Io. </p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">The Moon always shows Earth the same face</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth. Its near side is marked by large dark plains (volcanic ‘maria’) that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"> The Moon's surface is actually dark</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">The Sun and the Moon are not the same size</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>From Earth, both the Sun and the Moon look about same size. This is because, the Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun, but also 400 times closer to Earth.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">The Moon is drifting away from the Earth</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">There is water on the Moon!</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is in the form of ice trapped within dust and minerals on and under the surface. It has been detected on areas of the lunar surface that are in permanent shadow and are therefore very cold, enabling the ice to survive. The water on the Moon was likely delivered to the surface by comets.</p>
