                Mercury has been known for a long time because it is visible to the naked eye. Galileo Galilei made the first telescopic observation of this small planet in the 17th century. It was named after the swift Roman god of commerce.

                Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It lies at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles). In terms of the Earth-Sun distance, it is 0.4 AU. Measuring around 4,880 km (3,032 mi) across, Mercury is the smallest of all the eight planets. It is 2.6x smaller than our planet and is just slightly bigger than the Earth’s Moon.

                <p> Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun – also known as a gravitational lock – and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p> Despite its small size, Mercury is very dense because it is composed mainly of heavy metals and rock – the main characteristic of terrestrial planets.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Mercury is named after the messenger of the Roman gods</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>who is also known as Hermes in Greek mythology. This is because of the speed in which Mercury orbits the Sun and the speed with which Mercury the Roman deity was able to deliver messages.</p>

                <p>because of its low gravity and lack of atmosphere.</p>
