                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest of all the solar system planets. It was named after the king of the gods in Roman mythology. With an apparent magnitude of about -2, it is easily visible to the naked eye. In fact, it is the third brightest object in our night sky.
                <br>
                Jupiter is roughly 142,984 km (88,846 mi) across. With that size, we can put 11 Earths side by side along its equator. It is also the most massive planet. If we combine all the seven other planets, Jupiter would still be twice as massive. A day on Jupiter is only 10 hours long—the shortest in the solar system. A year on this giant planet is much longer, taking about 12 Earth years.

            <div class="content">
                <p>It is named for Jupiter, the king of the Roman gods and god of the Sky. The Greek equivalent is Zeus, god of thunder. For the Mesopotamians, he was the god Marduk and patron of the city of Babylon. Germanic tribes saw the planet as Donar, also known as Thor.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The planet rotates very Jupiter rotates very quickly, turning on its axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. This rapid rotation is also what causes the flattening effect of the planet, which is why it has an oblate shape.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p> This means that when viewed from Earth, the planet appears to move very slowly in the sky. It takes months for Jupiter to move from one constellation to the next.</p>

                <p>This includes the four large moons called the Galilean moons that were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>This is around 14 times stronger than the magnetic field found on Earth – the largest of any planet in the solar system.</p>

                <p>Those are Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, Ulysses and the New Horizons mission. Another mission, Juno, is set to arrive at Jupiter some time around July 2016. There are also plans for future missions to focus on the Jovian moons of Jupiter – Europa, Ganymede and Callisto – and their possible subsurface oceans.</p>
