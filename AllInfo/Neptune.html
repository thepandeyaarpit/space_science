                Neptune is the eighth planet and the farthest from the Sun. At 4.5 billion km (2.8 billion miles), it is 30 times as distant as the Earth is from the Sun. It was named after the god of the sea in Roman mythology.
                <br>
                The astronomer Urbain Le Verrier made mathematical predictions about Neptune’s existence. Using his calculations, Johann Galle discovered the planet through a telescope in September 1846. Just days later, its largest moon, Triton, was also discovered. So far, 14 moons are known to orbit this planet. It also has a ring system.
