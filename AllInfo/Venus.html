                Venus is only the second-closest planet to the Sun but it is the hottest. It has a very thick atmosphere which traps the heat from the Sun, thus causing its temperature to rise. It got its name from the Roman goddess of love and beauty, whose Greek counterpart is Aphrodite.
                <br>
                This planet lies around 108 million km (67 million mi) from the Sun. It is 12,104 km (7,521 mi) across, about the same size as Earth. Because of that, it is often called “Earth’s twin.” However, other than size, the two are very different. Venus is scorching hot, with temperatures around 475 °C (900 °F).

            <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Interesting facts about the Venus</h3>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Venus is the second brightest natural object in the sky. </button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The planet has an apparent magnitude of -3.8 to -4.6, which makes it visible on a bright, clear day. The Moon is the only other natural object that is brighter.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Venus is sometimes referred to as the “morning star” and “evening star”</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This dates back to ancient civilizations who believed that Venus was in fact two distinct stars appearing in the sky. When the orbit of Venus overtakes Earth’s orbit, it changes from being visible at sunrise to being visible at sunset. They were known as Phosphorus and Hesperus by the Greeks, and Lucifer and Vesper by the Romans.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">One day on Venus is longer than one year.</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p> Due to the slow rotation on its axis, it takes 243 Earth-days to complete one rotation. The orbit of the planet takes 225 Earth-days – making a year on Venus shorter on day on Venus.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p> This may be, in part, due the brightness of the planet and may date back to the Babylonians in 1581 who referred to Venus as “bright queen of the sky”.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Venus is sometimes called Earth’s sister planet.</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This is because their size is very similar (there is only a 638 km different in diameter) and Venus has around 81% of Earth’s mass. They are also similarly located with Venus being the closest planet to Earth. Both planets also have a central core, a molten mantle and a crust.
                    Venus has no moons nor rings.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Venus rotate in the opposite direction to other planets.</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Most other planets rotate counter-clockwise on their axis, however Venus, like Uranus, rotates clockwise. This is known as a retrograde rotation and may have been caused by a collision with an asteroid or other object which caused the planet to change its rotational path.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system with an average surface temperature of 462°C (863°F).</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Also, Venus doesn’t tilt on its axis which means there are no seasons either. The atmosphere is a dense 96.5% carbon dioxide which traps heat and caused the greenhouse effect which evaporated any water sources billions of years ago</p>
